# nextSighting

The plan is to build something that can tell you when the next sighting for the space station will be at a specific location.

- validates city
- convert city to longitute and latitude
- queries http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json

nice to have
- can use in my website
- maybe connect to IFFT to send notifications
- can use address, not just city
- take weather into account - it it's raining you cant see it!
